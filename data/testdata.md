# Introduction

Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models that exemplify unsupervised deep learning. They use a probabilistic approach to encode data into a distribution of latent variables, enabling both data compression and the generation of new, similar data instances.

VAEs have become crucial in modern machine learning due to their ability to learn complex data distributions and generate new samples without requiring explicit labels. This versatility makes them valuable for tasks like image generation, enhancement, anomaly detection, and noise reduction across various domains including healthcare, autonomous driving, and multimedia generation.

This publication demonstrates five key applications of VAEs: data compression, data generation, noise reduction, anomaly detection, and missing data imputation. By exploring these diverse use cases, we aim to showcase VAEs' versatility in solving various machine learning problems, offering practical insights for AI/ML practitioners.

To illustrate these capabilities, we use the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. This well-known dataset, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images, provides a manageable yet challenging benchmark for exploring VAEs' performance in different data processing tasks. Through our examples with MNIST, we demonstrate how VAEs can effectively handle a range of challenges, from basic image compression to more complex tasks like anomaly detection and data imputation.

# Understanding VAEs

<h2> Basic Concept and Architecture</h2>
VAEs are a class of generative models designed to encode data into a compressed latent space and then decode it to reconstruct the original input. The architecture of a VAE consists of two main components: the encoder and the decoder.

![VAE_architecture.png](VAE_architecture.png)

The diagram above illustrates the key components of a VAE:

1. <b>Encoder:</b> Compresses the input data into a latent space representation.
2. <b>Latent Space (Z):</b> Represents the compressed data as a probability distribution, typically Gaussian.
3. <b>Decoder:</b> Reconstructs the original input from a sample drawn from the latent space distribution.

The encoder takes an input, such as an image, call it $X$, and compresses it into a set of parameters defining a probability distribution in the latent space—typically the mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution. This probabilistic approach is what sets VAEs apart; instead of encoding an input as a single point, it is represented as a distribution over potential values. The decoder then uses a sample from this distribution to reconstruct the original input (shows as $$\hat{X}$$). This sampling process would normally make the process non-differentiable. To overcome this challenge, VAEs use the so-called "reparameterization trick," which allows the model to back-propagate gradients through random operations by decomposing the sampling process into deterministic and stochastic components. This makes the VAE end-to-end differentiable which enables training using backpropagation.

<h2> Comparison with Traditional Auto-Encoders </h2>

While VAEs share some similarities with traditional auto-encoders, they have distinct features that set them apart. Understanding these differences is crucial for grasping the unique capabilities of VAEs. The following table highlights key aspects where VAEs differ from their traditional counterparts:

# VAE Example in PyTorch

To better understand the practical implementation of a Variational Autoencoder, let's examine a concrete example using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. This implementation is designed to work with the MNIST dataset, encoding 28x28 pixel images into a latent space and then reconstructing them.

The following code defines a VAE class that includes both the encoder and decoder networks. It also implements the reparameterization trick, which is crucial for allowing backpropagation through the sampling process. Additionally, we'll look at the loss function, which combines reconstruction loss with the Kullback-Leibler divergence to ensure the latent space has good properties for generation.

## Data Generation

Synthetic data generation plays a crucial role in AI/ML, especially when real data is scarce, sensitive, or expensive to collect. It's valuable for augmenting training datasets, improving model robustness, and providing controlled scenarios for testing and validation.

<h2> Generating New MNIST-like Digits with VAEs</h2>
VAEs stand out in their ability to generate new data that mimics the original training data. Here’s how VAEs can be used to generate new, MNIST-like digits:<br><br>

1. Training: A VAE is first trained on the MNIST dataset, learning the underlying distribution of the data represented in a latent space.<br><br>

2. Sampling: After training, new points are sampled from the latent space distribution. Because this space has been regularized during training (encouraged to approximate a Gaussian distribution), the samples are likely to be meaningful.<br><br>

3. Decoding: These sampled latent points are then passed through the decoder, which reconstructs new digits that reflect the characteristics of the training data but are novel creations.

<h2> Exploring the Latent Space: Morphing Between Digits</h2>
One of the fascinating capabilities of VAEs is exploring and visualizing the continuity and interpolation capabilities within the latent space:<br><br>

1. Continuous Interpolation: By choosing two points in the latent space corresponding to different digits, one can interpolate between these points. The decoder generates outputs that gradually transition from one digit to another, illustrating how features morph seamlessly from one to the other.<br><br>
2. Visualizing Morphing: This can be visualized by creating a sequence of images where each image represents a step from one latent point to another. This not only demonstrates the smoothness of the latent space but also the VAE’s ability to handle and mix digit features creatively.<br><br>
3. Insight into Latent Variables: Such explorations provide insights into what features are captured by different dimensions of the latent space (e.g., digit thickness, style, orientation).

We trained a VAE on MNIST with a 2D latent space for easy visualization and manipulation. This allows us to observe how changes in latent variables affect generated images. The figure below shows generated images for latent dimension values from -3 to 3 on both axes:

![vae_grid_plot.png](vae_grid_plot.png)

This exploration is not only a powerful demonstration of the model's internal representations but also serves as a tool for understanding and debugging the model’s behavior.

## Noise Reduction

Noise in data is a common issue in various fields, from medical imaging to autonomous vehicles. It can significantly degrade the performance of machine learning models, making effective denoising techniques crucial.

<h2> Demonstrating VAE-based Denoising on MNIST</h2>
We trained multiple VAEs to remove noise from MNIST images, testing different noise percentages. We created noisy images by randomly replacing a sample of pixels with values from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.

The following images show the denoising performance of VAEs at different levels of noise contamination:

![noisy_vs_denoised_0.05.jpg](noisy_vs_denoised_0.05.jpg)
![noisy_vs_denoised_0.1.jpg](noisy_vs_denoised_0.1.jpg)
![noisy_vs_denoised_0.25.jpg](noisy_vs_denoised_0.25.jpg)
![noisy_vs_denoised_0.5.jpg](noisy_vs_denoised_0.5.jpg)

Results seen in the charts above demonstrate the VAE's capability in reconstructing clean images from noisy inputs, highlighting its potential in restoring and enhancing image data usability in practical scenarios.

## Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection is crucial in various industries, identifying patterns that deviate from expected behavior. These anomalies can indicate critical issues such as fraudulent transactions or mechanical faults.

<h2> Using VAEs to Spot Anomalies in MNIST</h2>
VAEs can effectively detect anomalies by modeling the distribution of normal data:

1. The VAE is trained on MNIST digits.
2. Anomalies are identified by higher reconstruction loss on test set.
3. A threshold is set to flag digits with excessive loss as anomalies.

The histogram below shows reconstruction errors on the test set:

![reconstruction_errors_histogram.jpg](reconstruction_errors_histogram.jpg)

The following images show the top 10 digits with the highest loss, representing potential anomalies:

![highest_reconstruction_errors.jpg](highest_reconstruction_errors.jpg)

We can confirm that the 10 samples are badly written digits and should be considered anomalies.

To further test the VAE's anomaly detection capabilities, we tested the VAE model on images of letters—data that the model was not trained on. This experiment serves two purposes:

1. Validating the model's ability to identify clear out-of-distribution samples.
2. Exploring the nuances of how the model interprets shapes similar to digits.

The following chart shows the original images of letters and their reconstructions.

![letter_reconstruction.jpg](letter_reconstruction.jpg)

We also marked the reconstruction errors of the samples on the histogram of reconstruction errors from the test set.

![reconstruction_errors_with_letters.jpg](reconstruction_errors_with_letters.jpg)

These visualizations reveal several interesting insights:

1. Most letters, except 'Z', show poor reconstructions and high reconstruction errors, clearly marking them as anomalies.

2. The letter 'Z' is reconstructed relatively well, likely due to its similarity to the digit '2'. Its reconstruction error falls within the normal range of the test set.

3. The letter 'M' shows the most distorted reconstruction, corresponding to the highest reconstruction error. This aligns with 'M' being the most dissimilar to any MNIST digit.

4. Interestingly, 'H' is reconstructed to somewhat resemble the digit '8', the closest MNIST digit in shape. While still an anomaly, it has the lowest error among the non-'Z' letters.

This experiment highlights:

- The VAE's effectiveness in identifying clear anomalies (most letters).
- The model's tendency to interpret unfamiliar shapes in terms of the digits it knows.
- The importance of shape similarities in the model's interpretation, as demonstrated by the 'Z' and 'H' cases.

These observations underscore the VAE's capability in anomaly detection while also revealing its limitations when faced with out-of-distribution data that shares similarities with in-distribution samples.

## Missing Data Imputation

Incomplete data is a common challenge in machine learning, leading to biased estimates and less reliable models. This issue is prevalent in various domains, including healthcare and finance.

<h2> Reconstructing Partial MNIST Digits with VAEs </h2>

VAEs offer a robust approach to missing data imputation:

1. Training: A VAE learns the distribution of complete MNIST digits.

2. Simulating Missing Data: During training, parts of input digits are randomly masked. The VAE is tasked with reconstructing the full, original digit from this partial input.

3. Inference: When presented with new partial digits, the VAE leverages its learned distributions to infer and reconstruct missing sections, effectively filling in the gaps.

This process enables the VAE to generalize from partial information, making it adept at handling various missing data scenarios.

The image below demonstrates the VAE's capability in missing data imputation:

![missing_vs_reconstructed.jpg](missing_vs_reconstructed.jpg)

These examples illustrate how effectively the VAE infers and reconstructs missing parts of the digits, showcasing its potential for data imputation tasks.

# VAEs vs. GANs

While this publication has focused on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it's important to consider how they compare to other popular generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Both VAEs and GANs are powerful techniques for data generation in machine learning, but they approach the task in fundamentally different ways and have distinct strengths and weaknesses.

GANs, introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014, have gained significant attention for their ability to generate highly realistic images. They work by setting up a competition between two neural networks: a generator that creates fake data, and a discriminator that tries to distinguish fake data from real data. This adversarial process often results in very high-quality outputs, particularly in image generation tasks.

Understanding the differences between VAEs and GANs can help practitioners choose the most appropriate model for their specific use case. The following table provides a detailed comparison of these two approaches:

| Stability              | More stable training, consistent results                              | Can suffer from training instability                           |
| Primary Use Cases      | Data compression, denoising, anomaly detection, controlled generation | High-fidelity image generation, data augmentation              |
| Reconstruction Ability | Built-in reconstruction capabilities                                  | No inherent reconstruction ability                             |
| Inference              | Capable of inference on new data                                      | Typically requires additional techniques for inference         |

<h2> When to Choose VAEs over GANs </h2>

- Applications requiring both generation and reconstruction capabilities
- Tasks needing interpretable and controllable latent representations
- Scenarios demanding training stability and result consistency
- Projects involving data compression, denoising, or anomaly detection
- When balancing generation quality with ease of implementation and versatility
- When faster training times are preferred
